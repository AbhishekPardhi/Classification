    "# Assignment: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification refers to categorizing the given data into classes. For example,\n",
    "- Given an image of hand-written character, identifying the character (multi-class classification)\n",
    "- Given an image, annotating it with all the objects present in the image (multi-label classification)\n",
    "- Classifying an email as spam or non-spam (binary classification)\n",
    "- Classifying a tumor as benign or malignant and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be building a classifier to classify emails as spam or non-spam. We will be using the Kaggle dataset [Spam or Not Spam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ozlerhakan/spam-or-not-spam-dataset?resource=download) for this task. \n",

    "### Data pre-processing\n",
    "The first step in every machine learning algorithm is to process the raw data in some meaningful representations. We will be using the [Bag-of-Words](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971) representation to process the text. It comprises of following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process emails line-by-line to extract all the words.\n",
    "- Replace extracted words by their stem (root) word. This is known as stemming and lematization.\n",
    "- Remove stop words like and, or, is, am, and so on.\n",
    "- Assign a unique index to each word. This forms the vocabulary.\n",
    "- Represent each email as a binary vector of length equal to the size of the vocabulary such that the $i^{th}$ element of the vector is 1 iff the $i^th$ word is present in the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide you with the function signature along with the expected functionality. You are expected to complete them accordingly. "
