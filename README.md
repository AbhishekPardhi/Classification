- When prompted, give the file name of the data.csv(spam,non-spam), which is 'Input.csv'
- The input file (.csv) should contain the data for each field for each college and the output file should be preferably .txt
- You will get the visualized data plots and accuracy and area under the curve of each classifier :)
